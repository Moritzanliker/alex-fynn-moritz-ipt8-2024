Project Summary: Collaborative Task Manager Web Application

Project Name: TaskMaster

Objective: TaskMaster is a web-based task management platform designed for project teams to collaborate efficiently. The platform allows users to create and manage projects by organizing tasks (To-Dos) in a shared workspace, referred to as a "board." Each board can be associated with a project, and users within a group can contribute by adding, updating, or completing tasks. The goal is to enhance team productivity and ensure everyone is on the same page regarding project progress.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
Project Creation: Users can create projects and invite other users to collaborate.
Boards: Each project has a dedicated board where all related tasks (To-Dos) are listed.
Task Management: Users can create, update, and assign tasks within the board.
Group Collaboration: Multiple users can work on the same project, track task progress, and communicate through the platform.
Progress Tracking: The system provides visual indicators for task completion, helping teams stay on track.
Notifications: Users receive notifications for task updates, deadlines, and comments from other collaborators.
File Upload: Users can attach files to tasks to keep all necessary documentation in one place.
Comments: Team members can discuss tasks by adding comments directly to the tasks.
Dashboard: A central dashboard provides an overview of all active projects and tasks.
